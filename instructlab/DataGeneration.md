"'<|system|>\nYou are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.\n<|user|>\nYou are a very knowledgeable AI Assistant that will faithfully assist the user with their task.\nDevelop a series of question and answer pairs to perform a task.\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should be similar to provided examples. The generated instruction and the output should be grounded in the provided document.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. The output should be an appropriate response to the input and the instruction. Long outputs are preferable.\n\nThe task is Summarization of phone call transcripts between human agents and clients of a customer care department of a telecommunication service provider..\n\nHere is some context for the example question:\n\nJen (Customer Care Agent): Hello, this is Jen from customer care. How can I assist you today?\\n\\nChris (Customer): Hi Jen, I'm having trouble setting up my new smartphone. I just got it, and I'm trying to transfer my data from my old phone, but it's not working.\\n\\nJen: I'd be happy to help you with that, Chris. What's your phone number?\\n\\nChris: 294-804-2840\\n\\nJen: Can you please tell me a little bit more about the issue you're experiencing? What kind of phone did you have before, and what kind of phone do you have now?\\n\\nChris: I had an iPhone, and now I have a Samsung. I'm trying to transfer my contacts, photos, and messages, but the transfer process keeps failing.\\n\\nJen: Okay, let's try to troubleshoot this. Have you tried using the Smart Switch app that comes with your new Samsung phone?\\n\\nChris: Yes, I've tried that, but it's not working. It says there's a problem with the connection.\\n\\nJen: Alright, let's try a different method. Can you please go to the settings on your old iPhone, go to iCloud, and make sure that iCloud backup is turned on?\\n\\nChris: Okay, I've done that.\\n\\nJen: Great! Now, on your new Samsung phone, go to the settings, then accounts, and select \"Transfer data from iCloud.\" Follow the prompts to sign in with your Apple ID and select the backup you just created.\\n\\nChris: Okay, I think it's working now. The transfer process has started.\\n\\nJen: Excellent! I'm glad we were able to get that working for you, Chris. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.\\n\\nChris: Thanks so much, Jen! I really appreciate your help.\\n\\nJen: You're welcome, Chris. Enjoy your new phone, and have a great day!\n\nHere is an example to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for:\n\nSummarize the transcript of the call. Identify the agent and the subscriber. Add any specific issues mentioned by the subscriber. Add any corrective actions taken as directed by the agent. Please mention if the issue is resolved. Mention any follow-up actions and timelines. List the phone number of the subscriber at the end.\n**Agent:** Jen\\n**Subscriber:** Chris\\n**Specific Issues:** Chris was having trouble transferring data from his old iPhone to his new Samsung phone using the Smart Switch app.**Corrective Actions:** Jen directed Chris to use iCloud backup on his old iPhone and then transfer the data to his new Samsung phone using the iCloud transfer option.\\n**Issue Resolved:** Yes, the issue was resolved, and Chris was able to successfully transfer his data.\\n**Follow-up Actions and Timelines:** None mentioned.\\n**Subscriber's Phone Number:** 294-804-2840\n\nProvide a single question and answer pair based on the example.\n<|assistant|>\n'"
```

Output:
```
" \n\nHere is a single question and answer pair based on the example:\n\n**Question:** What is the main issue that Chris is facing with his new smartphone, and how does Jen assist him in resolving it?\n\n**Answer:** Chris is having trouble transferring data from his old iPhone to his new Samsung phone using the Smart Switch app. Jen assists him by directing him to use iCloud backup on his old iPhone and then transfer the data to his new Samsung phone using the iCloud transfer option. This resolves the issue, and Chris is able to successfully transfer his data."
