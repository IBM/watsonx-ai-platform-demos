#001,15.10.2024 09:00,John Doe,john.doe@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,Low,"I'm trying to execute a routine named GET_CUSTOMER_DATA in DB2, but it returns an error: 'Routine not found in schema.' I double-checked the routine name, and it exists in the catalog.",Checked the routine name and verified it exists in the catalog.,Lisa Smith,15.10.2024 12:00,Open,"The issue could be due to the schema not being specified in the call. Advise the user to prefix the routine with the schema name, e.g., schema_name.GET_CUSTOMER_DATA.",(Pending),(Pending)
#002,15.10.2024 09:30,Sarah Lee,sarah.lee@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,Medium,A routine that usually runs in under 2 minutes is now timing out after 30 minutes. No changes were made to the routine or database. How do I resolve this?,None,Mike Johnson,16.10.2024 14:00,In Progress,Investigate potential database locking or blocking issues. Advise checking for long-running transactions or locks using db2pd -locks or reviewing system performance metrics.,(Pending),(Pending)
#003,15.10.2024 10:00,Emily Carter,emily.carter@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,Medium,The CALCULATE_DISCOUNT routine is returning incorrect discount values for VIP customers. We recently updated the customer table. Could the routine be affected by this?,Verified table updates.,Michael Brooks,16.10.2024 15:00,In Progress,The issue might be due to a change in the customer table that affects the logic. Recommend reviewing the routine's SQL logic and verifying that it references the correct data structure after the update.,(Pending),(Pending)
#004,15.10.2024 10:30,Kevin Oâ€™Neil,kevin.oneil@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,Low,I'm getting a compilation error when creating a routine. The error message is: 'SQL0407N Assignment of a NULL value to a NOT NULL column.' What am I doing wrong?,None,Susan Green,15.10.2024 13:00,Open,The error indicates that a NULL value is being assigned to a column that does not allow NULLs. Suggest reviewing the routine to ensure no NULL values are assigned to NOT NULL fields.,(Pending),(Pending)
#005,15.10.2024 11:00,David Brown,david.brown@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,Medium,"ORDER Our routine PROCESS_works fine for most orders, but fails with an 'SQLSTATE 22001: String data, right truncation' error when processing large order numbers. Any idea what's going wrong?",None,Tom Baker,16.10.2024 16:00,In Progress,This is likely due to a string length constraint. Advise checking the routine to ensure the order number field can handle larger strings or suggest increasing the field length in the routine.,(Pending),(Pending)
#006,15.10.2024 11:30,Maria Gomez,maria.gomez@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,High,"After restoring our DB2 database from a backup, one of our routines, UPDATE_INVENTORY, is missing. How do I recover it?",None,Jason Miller,16.10.2024 17:00,Open,"Check the backup integrity and the catalog. If the routine was not included in the backup, advise restoring from an older backup or re-creating the routine manually based on its last known state.",(Pending),(Pending)
#007,15.10.2024 12:00,Lisa Nguyen,lisa.nguyen@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,High,"Our GENERATE_SALES_REPORT routine runs smoothly during off-peak hours, but significantly slows down during peak hours. Could this be related to system load?",None,Alan Roberts,17.10.2024 11:00,In Progress,"Yes, the slowdown could be due to increased system load or resource contention. Recommend analyzing the system's performance metrics (CPU, memory, I/O) during peak hours and possibly optimizing the routine to handle concurrency better.",(Pending),(Pending)
#008,15.10.2024 12:30,Chris Taylor,chris.taylor@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,Low,"When I try to execute the DELETE_OLD_RECORDS routine, I get an error: 'SQL0551N User does not have the required authorization.' I have admin privileges.",None,Kate Morgan,15.10.2024 16:00,Open,"Even with admin privileges, specific permissions may be required for executing certain routines. Check the routine's specific permissions and grant EXECUTE access if missing.",(Pending),(Pending)
#009,15.10.2024 13:00,Bob Wilson,bob.wilson@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,High,"A nested routine PROCESS_PAYMENT is failing within another routine, COMPLETE_ORDER, with an 'SQLCODE=-911, SQLSTATE=40001' deadlock error. How can I resolve this?",None,Rachel Adams,17.10.2024 13:00,In Progress,"This error suggests a deadlock situation. Investigate the transaction isolation levels and locking mechanisms in both routines, advising changes to avoid deadlock situations (e.g., by reordering transactions or handling locks explicitly).",(Pending),(Pending)
#010,15.10.2024 13:30,Hannah Cooper,hannah.cooper@example.com,Database - DB2 Routine,Medium,"The GET_EMPLOYEE_DETAILS routine is returning NULL for certain employees, but there should be data. We haven't modified the table or routine recently.",None,Eric Turner,16.10.2024 18:00,Open,"This could be caused by missing or incorrect data in the source table. Recommend checking if any of the employee records have NULL values for critical fields, or if the routine logic has conditional checks that may lead to a NULL return.",(Pending),(Pending)
