"I'm trying to execute a routine named GET_CUSTOMER_DATA in DB2, but it returns an error: 'Routine not found in schema.' I double-checked the routine name, and it exists in the catalog.","The issue could be due to the schema not being specified in the call. Advise the user to prefix the routine with the schema name, e.g., schema_name.GET_CUSTOMER_DATA.","Dear [Client's Name],

Thank you for reaching out to the IT Helpdesk regarding the issue you're experiencing with the GET_CUSTOMER_DATA routine in DB2. I understand that you’re receiving a ""Routine not found in schema"" error, even though the routine is listed in the catalog.

To resolve this, please try specifying the schema name when calling the routine. For instance, use schema_name.GET_CUSTOMER_DATA (replacing ""schema_name"" with the actual schema of the routine). This will ensure DB2 can accurately locate the routine.

If the issue persists after making this adjustment, please let us know, and we’ll be happy to assist further.
