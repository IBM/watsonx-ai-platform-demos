yarn start:appOneLLMOneAgent
Prompt LLM:
Summarize the transcript of the call. Identify the agent and the subscriber. Add any specific issues mentioned by the subscriber. Add any corrective actions taken as directed by the agent. Please mention if the issue is resolved. Mention any follow-up actions and timelines. And list the phone number of the subscriber at the end.

Transcript:

John (Teltop Customer Care Agent): Hello, this is John from Teltop customer care. How can I assist you today?

Mary (Disappointed Subscriber): Hi John, it's Mary again. I've been having a nightmare with your service. My home Wi-Fi is acting up, and the TV service over fiber is terrible.

John: I'm sorry to hear about the troubles you're facing at home, Mary. Let's address these issues. Can you please provide me with your account number or the phone number associated with your account?

Mary: Sure, it's 123-555-1234.

John: Thank you. Can you provide me with more details about the Wi-Fi problems and the TV service quality?

Mary: The Wi-Fi keeps dropping, and the TV service over fiber is pixelated and glitchy. It's making it impossible to enjoy any show or movie.

John: I understand how frustrating that can be, Mary. Let me check our system to see if there are any reported issues in your area.

John checks the system and finds no reported issues in Mary's area.

John: Mary, it seems there are no reported issues in your area. It could be a specific problem with your equipment or connection. Can you check if all cables are properly connected and if there are any obstructions to the router?

Mary: I've checked, and everything seems fine. This is so frustrating!

John: I'm sorry to hear that, Mary. It might be best to perform a remote diagnostic check on your router. I can guide you through the process.

John guides Mary through the diagnostic check, and it reveals some issues with the router.

John: Mary, it appears there are some issues with your router. We need to update the router software. Additionally, I'll address the TV service quality. There might be a signal issue or equipment malfunction.

Mary: Finally some answers! When will the router be updated, and how soon can you fix the TV service?

John: We'll start the router update immediately. As for the TV service, our team will work on it directly, and you should see improvements within the next 24 hours.

Mary: Well, it's about time! I hope this gets sorted out.

John: I appreciate your patience, Mary. To make up for the inconvenience, I'd like to offer you three months of free TV service once everything is resolved. Does that sound fair?

Mary: That's more like it, John. I appreciate the offer. Let's hope the technician and your team can fix these issues once and for all.

John: Thank you for understanding, Mary. We're committed to providing you with a seamless experience. If you have any other concerns or questions, feel free to reach out.

Mary: Thanks, John. I'll take the offer for the free TV service, and let's hope things get better soon.

John: Absolutely, Mary. We appreciate your loyalty, and we're here to make things right. If there's anything else, don't hesitate to contact us. Have a great day!
