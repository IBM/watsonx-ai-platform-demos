# Crewai to run a multi agent IT-Support Assistant
![alt text](image-1.png)


### Sources 
- I used notebooks from [this course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/) as the basis for this demo

- Additionaly there is a limited amount of information in [IBM Developer Blog](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/awb-leveraging-crewai-and-ibm-watsonx/)

### Notes
- I also tried implementing observability using the [agentops framework](https://www.agentops.ai/?=crew) . I did not get it to work though. I suspect that the usage of the watsonx models and the use in a notebook messes with the preconfigured listeners. This definitly is an important aspect to explore though.
